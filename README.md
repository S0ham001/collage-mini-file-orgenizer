## üß† How It Works

The script scans the specified directory, determines how to sort the files based on your selected option, and automatically creates destination folders to move them accordingly.

It uses:
- `os` ‚Üí For file path operations  
- `shutil` ‚Üí To move files  
- `datetime` ‚Üí To format file modification dates  
- `tkinter` ‚Üí For GUI and user interaction

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface

When you run the script, a simple window appears:

1. **Path Field:** Choose the folder you want to organize.  
2. **Browse Button:** Opens a dialog to select a directory.  
3. **Sort Type:** Choose between:
 - A-Z  
 - Extension  
 - Date  
4. **Sort Button:** Starts the organization process.

After completion, a message box appears showing **‚ÄúDone!‚Äù**
